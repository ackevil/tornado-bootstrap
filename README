Tornado-Bootstrap
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a small project for bootstrapping web applications using Tornado and SQLAlchemy.
It comes with a very simple application illustrating handlers, entities and testing. This
can be modified as necessary in order to build a proper application.

Makefile usage ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Makefile.example file is provided as stub for a proper Makefile. After copying it, the
PYTHON, EASYINSTALL and NOSETESTS variables should be modified to point to the location of
these variables in the current system.

The following rules are implemented:

server:		start the server

test:		execute all tests

database:	create the database

deps:		install dependencies

clean:		remove .pyc files

The server will fail the execute properly if:
	- there are non-installed dependencies,
	- the database isn't present.

Database settings ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The database URI and the object-relational mapping are configured at:
	src/config/database.py
